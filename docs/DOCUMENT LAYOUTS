DOCUMENT LAYOUTS

INTRODUCTION

If you need to apply the same collection of fields and signatures to several document, Document Layouts can save you a good amount of effort.  By saving a document as a layout, you will be able to recreate the same fields in the same positions in another document.

First we will create a new Package, and upload a document.  We'll create some signatures and fields within the document, and then save the layout of that document for future use.  We'll then add a new Document and apply the layout to it.
