AUTHENTICATION

INTRODUCTION
This example demonstrates the different authentication mechanisms available to signers.  When a signer is invited to participate in a package, an authentication method is selected: Email, Q&A or SMS.  

AUTHENTICATION METHODS
Email authentication is the default and is the simplest method.  A link is emailed to the signer.  No further authentication, beyond being able to access the email is required to participate in the package.
Q&A authentication also sends a link to the signer.  Upon clicking on the link, they will be prompted to answer one or more questions.  The creator of the package will have chosen these questions and answers.  The signer must answer one of the questions correctly, or they will be unable to paticipate in the signing.
SMS authentication also sends a link to the signer.  Also sent to the signer, via SMS, is a unique code.  Upon clicking on the link in the email, the signer will be prompted to enter the SMS code they received.  The signer must enter the correct code to be able to begin signing.

SAMPLE
This below sample demonstrates the addition of three new Signers to a Package.  Each signer is expected to authenticate in a different manner.  Signer1's authentication is achieved by email, Signer2's authentication is achieved by Q&A and Signer3's authentication is achieved by SMS.
